      <h2>Purva Patel</h2>
      <p>I am currently a student at the University of Illinois at Chicago, pursuing my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Engineering along with minors in Art and Mathematics. I have more knowledge and am interested in studio art rather than digital art. I usually do realism and landscaping art, however I am also interested in abstract and contemporary art. I do enjoy doing digital art using creative coding. I learned a lot doing digital art and my favorite part was creating meaningful sketches using p5 and using CSS to modify the HTML files.</p>
