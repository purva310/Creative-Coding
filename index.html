      <h2>Purva Patel</h2>
      <p>Purva is currently a student at the University of Illinois at Chicago, pursuing her Bachelor's of Science in Computer Engineering along with minors in Art and Mathematics. Purva has more knowledge and is interested in studio art rather than digital art. She usually does realism and landscaping art, however she is also interested in abstract and contemporary art. Purva likes to use her technical background while creating art or vice versa. As a fast learner, she learned all the basic skills that were required to do her projects for a creative coding portfolio. Purva puts her 100% while working on a project and if sheâ€™s not satisfied with what she created she wouldn't display it and she would try to fix it and figure out what went wrong.</p>
