      <h2>Purva Patel</h2>
      <p>I graduated from the University of Illinois at Chicago, with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Engineering along with minors in Art and Mathematics. I have more knowledge and am interested in studio art rather than digital art. I usually do realism and landscaping art, however I am also interested in abstract and contemporary art. I do enjoy doing digital art using creative coding. I learned a lot doing digital art and my favorite part was creating meaningful sketches using p5 and using CSS to modify the HTML files. Some of my sketches are inspired from the paintings Iâ€™ve done in the past. While creating digital art, the one thing I keep in mind is that it has playfulness or has a satisfactory affect.</p>
