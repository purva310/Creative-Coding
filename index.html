      <h2>Purva Patel</h2>
      <p>I am currently a student at the University of Illinois at Chicago, pursuing my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Engineering along with minors in Art and Mathematics. I have more knowledge and am interested in studio art rather than digital art. I usually do realism and landscaping art, however I am also interested in abstract and contemporary art. I like to use my technical background while creating art or vice versa. As a fast learner, I learned all the basic skills that were required to do my projects for a creative coding portfolio. I put my 100% while working on a project and if I am not satisfied with what I created I wouldn't display it and would try to fix it and figure out what went wrong.</p>
